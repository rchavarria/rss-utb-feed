# rss-utb-feed

> A manually created RSS feed of videos extracted as audio files

# Goal of the project

rss-utb-feed will use GitHub pages feature to publish static web pages, where each page contains a link and a description of an interesting video.

There will be a RSS feed, with links to audio files, so that Podcast Android applications can download the audio and one can listen videos from different sources in its phone.
